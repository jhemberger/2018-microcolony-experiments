# Microcolony Landscape Resource Simulation Experiments
## Daily working notes and ideas

#### Summary Figures To Make: 
- [ ] Step plot for drone production over time
- [ ] Mass-gain of MC over experiment period
- [x] Diverging z-score plot of drone production
- [ ] Diverging z-score plot of avg. daily mass gain
- [ ] Nectar consumption over time
- [ ] Pollen consumption over time

#### Data Checking
- [ ] Correlogram 
- [ ] Data shape/spread/normality checks 

#### Data Cleanup
- [ ] Food consumption calculations (averaging out left-over pollen)
- [ ]
