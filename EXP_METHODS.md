# Microcolony Landscape Resource Simulation Experiments
## Methods and Feeding Protocol

Microcolonies in this experiment are being subjected to a feeding treatment regime meant to simulate different landscapes in terms of resource abundance, and access over time.  Rations of pollen and nectar are based of of a 5 worker maximum consumption level (ad-libitum feeding) from Rotheray et al. (2017).  There are four treatments, or zones to which microcolonies are assigned, shown below: 

Treatment | Description
--------- | -----------
**Zone 1** | 60% of ad-lib ration for both pollen and nectar.  All rations are equally sized and spaced over the duration of the experiment.  Simulates a landscape with low levels of food that are constantly available.
**Zone 2** | 100% of ad-lib ration for both pollen and nectar.  Simulates a landscape with abundant floral resources that are constantly available over time.  
**Zone 3** | 100% of ad-lib ration for both pollen and nectar.  However, rations are reduced for the bulk of the feeding dates, and the difference is made up during two "pulses" of pollen and nectar during weeks 2 and 6.  Simulates a landscape with low levels of food availability, and then large mass-flowering events.
**Zone 4** | 60% of ad-lib ration for both pollen and nectar.  Like `Zone 3`, execpt with reduced food availability.  

Total experiment food availability: `Zone 1` == `Zone 4` | `Zone 2` == `Zone 3`

### Feed Day Tasks
- [ ] Prepare pollen and nectar rations
- [ ] Feed, mass, assess, and photograph microcolonies
- [ ] Fill humidifer reserviors
- [ ] Wash and sterilize nectar cups and all materials
- [ ] Wipe down all surfaces with bleach solution

### Every Third (Weekly) Feed Tasks
- [ ] Remove all pollen previously provided and mass remaining


### Other Tasks
- [ ] Ensure nectar wicks are prepped
- [ ] Fill huimidifer reserviors 
- [ ]
